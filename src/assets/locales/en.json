I studied it more actively in 11th grade and in my first year of university. I was most interested in the MERN stack: Mongo, Express, React, Node.js. Therefore, in the future, I would like to work with these technologies, but I would also like to try something new and complement my hard skills. And while working in a team, I would like to improve my soft skills as well."
